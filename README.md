# Sprite Clicker PWA

This is a simple PWA version of the clicker.

## Optional assets
Drop these files into `assets/` to match the original look:

- `sprite.jpg` (sprite sheet, 3 rows x 4 columns)
- `background.jpg` (background image)

If you do not add them, the app runs with a placeholder background and message.

## Local run
From this folder:

```
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` on your phone (same Wi-Fi) or on desktop.

## Install as PWA
On mobile Chrome:

- Open the site.
- Tap the menu and choose "Add to Home screen".
